![Deployment with Docker - Srdjan Grubor](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781786469007/cover/smaller){: .img-left}
A few months ago I decided to deep-in my understanding of containers reading some book about the Docker. I chose the [”Deployment with Docker” by Srdjan Grubor](https://www.packtpub.com/product/deployment-with-docker/9781786469007). The book is pretty good, it has some chapters answering the question ”Why were containers developed and what are the alternatives to Docker”.

It covers the topic of container orchestration with Docker Swarm as an example and explains the differences between other alternatives. It has a lot of hacks from an experienced developer which will help you to avoid some mistakes or at least understand where you should look for the problem. At the end of the book, there is a pretty good example of how to deploy your containerized application to Amazon EC2 instances using Ansible as a configuration management tool and Jenkins for continuous delivery. If you are not much experienced in how are distributed systems deployed and how to automate your deployments and configurations (f.e. to create and configure new instances when the load is increasing and remove them otherwise), it could be a good chapter for you to start with.

I can recommend this book to be read by everyone who only starts his way in developing containerized applications or wants to deep-in his understanding of Docker.
