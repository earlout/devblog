Honestly, I decided to create this blog to write posts about technologies, my new skills, or projects I develop. I am currently working on one interesting (at least for me) application, and I will mention it later in this post. But it will take a lot of time for me to finish it and write some information here to my blog, so I decided that there is no need to wait and I can type something that I want to share because blogs are for some people wanting to share their thoughts with others.

In this post, I will talk about my new device called Apple Watch 5 and how it changed my life :). I received it on the 8th of July and immediately started using its health and workouts features that I want to discuss here. I ordered it on the official Apple web page and tried the "Create your style" feature, so I finally bought the 44mm Gold Aluminum Case with Space Black Milanese Loop set. I need to clarify that here, in the Czech Republic, there is no other than Aluminium configuration present, but I don't think I would buy the other one even if they were available.

I will not mention the technical details, because even I am not interested in it. It is a health device that replaces my previous Swiss watch, and only one thing I am interested in is that it should work fast and be reliable. The only important technical feature for me is the Always-On Display, which allows me to see the time or training information even if the screen is locked.

There are a lot of Watch Faces, and I use many of them, especially after the moment I started using the Dock to open the apps, and widgets stopped being necessary for me. Now I have 3 bands, and I really like to combine them with Watch Faces based on my today's mood.

I have a lot of apps on my Apple Watch, but I frequently use only a few of them. I talk about Things 3, which has a perfect widget showing my today's progress and voice dictation for task creation, AutoSleep to track my sleeping and because of smart alarm which wakes me up smoothly with Haptics, Activity app to track, and complete my daily goals, Workout app and Nike Training Club for workouts, Calendar to track my events, Water Reminder to make sure that I drink enough water, Medisafe for my pills reminders, Spotify for music, Timer, and sometimes Siri thanks to "Raise your wrist" feature.

After buying the Apple Watch I really started to live a healthier life. I use a YAZIO application to track what I am eating, I started doing sports and finally started to lose my weight, and that's all thanks to my new watch. There are a lot of workouts that the Watch can track, but sometimes I use the Nike Training Club if I want something new to try.

Now there are a lot of data, my Watch tracks and saves to Apple Health, which is not very comfortable for me to use, so I am creating a Dashboard application with a service which would be synchronized with my Apple Health data and application will read them and show some statistics, important information in calendar view, and graphs. It is only a basic feature set and I am planning to extend it in the future. So, when I will finish at least the basic functionality, I will type a post about it here on my blog.

Finally, I can say that I can recommend it for everyone who wants to live a healthier life, or who needs the smart fitness tracker with other side features because an Apple Watch has a lot of them thanks to the App Store.
