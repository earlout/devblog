title: About me
---

I am a Software Engineer living and working in Prague, Czech Republic. Most of all, I develop web applications back-end in Spring Framework.

Experienced in front-end development with React and Typescript.

Truly like developing microservices running in Docker.

Apple user, geek, and just a good person.
